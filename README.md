## Bresenham Line Drawing algorithm in 3D Unity

This is a unity simulation of Bresenham's line drawing algorithm in Unity 3D.

Keys:

* Arrow Keys - Move horizontally & vertically
* `i` - move inwards (along the +ve Z axis)
* `shift+i` - move outwards (along the -ve Z axis)

* Same navigation keys with `Ctrl` will move the camera
* Same navigation keys with `Alt` pressed will rotate the scene.
* press space to select a point. For every 2 points selected, a line will be drawn.
